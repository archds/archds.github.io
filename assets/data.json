        "I really like Rust for several reasons. First and foremost, it's a language  that prioritizes safety and performance. Its strict compiler catches many programming errors at compile time, which saves me from dealing with hard-to-debug runtime issues. At last, but not least, I know Rust as parent for many high-performance and reliable developing tools, such as Pydantic and Ruff, and that gives me inspiration to work with."
