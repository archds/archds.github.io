      - Python is my primary developing tool. I like Python because it's so easy to read
        and write. Its clean  and simple syntax makes coding a breeze, and I find it great
        for variety of tasks.  The huge and active Python community means I'm never short  on
        resources and help when I need it. Python is very flexible and with good philosophy
        you can make reliable tools and products

      - I really like Rust for several reasons. First and foremost, it's a language  that
        prioritizes safety and performance. Its strict compiler catches many programming
        errors at compile time, which saves me from dealing with hard-to-debug runtime
        issues. At last, but not least, I know Rust as parent for many high-performance
        and reliable developing tools, such as Pydantic and Ruff, and that gives me inspiration
        to work with.

      - Despite as I like programming, I see how important other things for building a
        robust systems. Some tools are industry standard and not giving them enough attention
        would be a mistake. Also social interaction and task-management tools is important
        too, so I prefer not giving that part of work aside.
